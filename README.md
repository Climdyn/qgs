General Information
-------------------

qgs is a Python implementation of an atmospheric model for midlatitudes.  It models the dynamics of
a 2-layer [quasi-geostrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-geostrophic_equations) channel
atmosphere on a [beta-plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_plane), coupled to a simple land or
[shallow-water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations) ocean component.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to run qgs is to use an appropriate environment created through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

First install Anaconda and clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Climdyn/qgs.git

Then install and activate the Python3 Anaconda environment:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate qgs

You can then perform a test by running the script

    python qgs_rp.py
    
to see if everything runs smoothly (this should take less than a minute).

#### Note for Windows and MacOS users

Presently, qgs is compatible with Windows and MacOS but users wanting to use qgs inside their Python scripts must guard the main script with a

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
```

clause and add the following lines below

```
  from multiprocessing import freeze_support
  freeze_support()
```

About this usage, see for example the main scripts `qgs_rp.py` and `qgs_maooam.py` in the root folder.
Note that the Jupyter notebooks are not concerned by this recommendation and work perfectly well on both operating systems.

> **Why?** These lines are required to make the multiprocessing library works with these operating systems. See [here](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/multiprocessing.html) for more details, 
> and in particular [this section](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/multiprocessing.html#the-spawn-and-forkserver-start-methods).


#### Activating DifferentialEquations.jl optional support

In addition to the qgs builtin Runge-Kutta integrator, the qgs model can alternatively be integrated with a package called [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl) written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and available through the
[diffeqpy](https://github.com/SciML/diffeqpy) python package.
The diffeqpy package first installation step is done by Anaconda in the qgs environment but then you must [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow the final manual installation instruction found in the [diffeqpy README](https://github.com/SciML/diffeqpy).

These can be summed up as opening a terminal and doing:
```
conda activate qgs
python
```
and then inside the Python command line interface do:

```
>>> import diffeqpy
>>> diffeqpy.install()
```
which will then finalize the installation. An example of a notebook using this package is available in the documentation and on [readthedocs](https://qgs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/files/examples/diffeq.html).

Documentation
-------------

To build the documentation, please run (with the conda environment activated):

    cd documentation
    make html

You may need to install [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) if it is not already present on your system.
Once built, the documentation is available [here](./documentation/build/html/index.html).

The documentation is also available online on read the docs: [https://qgs.readthedocs.io/](https://qgs.readthedocs.io/)

Usage
-----

qgs can be used by editing and running the script `qgs_rp.py` and `qgs_maooam.py` found in the main folder.

For more advanced usages, please read the [User Guides](https://qgs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/files/user_guide.html).

Examples
--------

Another nice way to run the model is through the use of Jupyter notebooks. 
Simple examples can be found in the [notebooks folder](./notebooks).
For instance, running 

    conda activate qgs
    cd notebooks
    jupyter-notebook
    
will lead you to your favorite browser where you can load and run the examples.

Dependencies
------------

qgs needs mainly:

   * [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) for numeric support
   * [sparse](https://sparse.pydata.org/) for sparse multidimensional arrays support
   * [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) for code acceleration
   * [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/) for symbolic manipulation of inner products
   
Check the yaml file [environment.yml](./environment.yml) for the dependencies.
