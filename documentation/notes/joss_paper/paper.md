# Summary

`qgs` is a a Python implementation of a set of idealized reduced-order models representing atmospheric mid-latitude variability. 
It consists of a two-layer *q*uasi-*g*eostrophic *s*pectral (`qgs`) model of the atmosphere on a beta-plane, coupled either to a simple land surface or to a shallow-water ocean. 
The model's dynamical fields include the atmospheric and oceanic streamfunction and temperature fields, and the land temperature field.

* In the case where it is coupled to an ocean, it reproduces the Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model (MAOOAM), described in @DDV2016. In @VDDG2015, a 36-variable configuration of this model was shown to reproduce a 
low-frequency variability (LFV) typical of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. 
This coupling consists in both mechanical and heat exchange interactions between the two components. 
The model has already been used in different contexts, in particular for data assimilation [@PBBCDSY2019; @TCVB2020], 
and predictability studies [@VSD2019; @VD2020]
* In the case of a land surface coupling, it emulates the model proposed in @RP1982 and @CT1987 with a simple thermal relaxation toward a climatological temperature and a mechanical coupling due to the 
friction between the land and the atmosphere. It can also emulate the model proposed in @LHHBD2018, with mechanical coupling and heat exchange. In addition, the number of dynamical spectral modes can be configured by the user, as is the case for the MAOOAM model.

In the `qgs` framework, the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern the time evolution of its fields are projected on a basis of functions defined on its 
spatial domain. 
This kind of decomposition transforms the PDEs into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which can then be solved with the usual integration techniques.
Presently in `qgs`, the functions of the basis are chosen amongst the orthogonal Fourier modes compatible with the boundary conditions of each subcomponent of the system, namely the atmosphere, and the ocean or the land surface coupled to it. 
A future development is planned that will enable the user to specify the basis of functions for each component, depending on the required boundary conditions.

The model implementation consists of submodules to set up the model's parameters and to compute the tensor that defines the coefficients of the system of ODEs^[More details about the implementation can be found in @DDV2016 and in the *Code Description* section of the included documentation.].
This tensor is used by the code to compute the tendencies function and its Jacobian matrix. These functions can then be fed to the `qgs` built-in Runge-Kutta integrator or 
to another integrator implemented by the user. As an example, the usage of the Julia `DifferentialEquations.jl` [@RN2017] integration package through the Python `diffeqpy` [@diffeqpy] package is provided.
The tangent linear and adjoint models [@K2003] are also available and allow one to easily conduct data assimilation and linear sensitivity analysis experiments.

The model implementation uses NumPy [@vCV2011; @O2006] and SciPy [@scipy] for arrays and computations support, as well as Numba [@numba] and sparse [@sparse] to considerably accelerate the tensor products computation used to compute the tendencies.


# Statement of need

In atmospheric and climate sciences, research and development is often first conducted with a simple idealized system like the Lorenz-$N$ models ($N \in \{63, 84, 96\}$) [@L63; @L84; @L96] which are toy models of atmospheric variability. 
The first two models are heavily truncated systems (3-variable) describing the very large synoptic-scale dynamics of the single-component atmosphere, that neglect the interaction with other components of the climate system and with smaller scales.
The third one is based on reasonable heuristic assumptions on the spatial dynamics along a latitude, which may however lead to unrealistic statistical features. 

Reduced-order spectral quasi-geostrophic models of the atmosphere with a large number of modes offer better representations of the dry atmospheric dynamics [@OB1989]. 
The dynamics thus obtained allow one to identify typical features of the atmospheric circulation, such as blocked and zonal circulation regimes, and low-frequency variability.
However, these models are less often considered in literature, despite their demonstration of more realistic behavior.

`qgs` aims to popularize these systems by providing a fast and easy-to-use Python framework for researchers and teachers to integrate this kind of model. 
For an efficient handling of the model by users, its documentation is conceived such that its equations and parameters are explained and linked to the code.
In the future, its development will be done in a modular fashion which enables the connection of the atmosphere to various other subsystems and the use of built-in and external toolboxes.

The choice to use Python was specifically made to facilitate its use in Jupyter Notebooks [@jupyter] and with the multiple recent machine learning libraries that are available in this
language.

# State of the field

Other software might interest the reader in need of an easy-to-use idealized atmospheric model.

* MAOOAM: The Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model, a coupled ocean-atmosphere model included in `qgs` [@MAOOAM]. 
          Code available in Lua, Fortran and Python.
* q-gcm: A mid-latitude grid-based quasi-geostrophic ocean-atmosphere model with two oceanic layers. Code in Fortran, interface in Python [@qgcm].
* pyqg: A pseudo-spectral Python solver for quasi-geostrophic systems [@pyqg]. Allow one to create and solve multiple-layers quasi-geostrophic systems.
* Isca: A research General Circulation Model (GCM) to simulate global dynamics. Written in Fortran and largely
        configurable with Python scripts, with internal coding changes required for non-standard cases [@Vetal2018; @Isca].

`qgs` distinguishes itself from these other models by the combination of a simplified and configurable geometry, a spectral discretization, an efficient numerical implementation of the ODE system by a sparse tensor multiplication, 
and the availability of the tangent linear and adjoint models. As such it is very suitable to quickly simulate very long time periods while capturing key aspects of the climate dynamics at mid-latitudes.

The mechanically coupled atmosphere-land configuration of `qgs` was used to test new ideas using response theory to adapt statistical postprocessing schemes to model changes [@DV2020].
The MAOOAM model configuration of `qgs` was recently considered to perform strongly-coupled data assimilation experiments in the ocean-atmosphere system [@CBDGRV2020].

# Performance

The performance of the `qgs` MAOOAM implementation has been benchmarked against the Lua and Fortran implementations of this model [@MAOOAM].
This comparison was done on a recent Intel CPU with 12 cores, with two different model resolutions: one used in @VDDG2015 and one truncated at the wavenumber 6 for both the oceanic and atmospheric components.
The former leads to a 36-dimensional system of ODEs while the latter is higher-dimensional, using 228 variables.
 
In both cases, all the different code implementations have been initialized with the same initial data and parameters, except for the length of the trajectory being computed. 
The low-dimensional system was integrated for 10$^7$ timeunits (roughly $\sim$ 1850 years) while the higher-dimensional one was integrated over 10$^6$ timeunits ($\sim$ 185 years).
In the case of the Fortran implementation, two different compilers (GNU Gfortran and Intel Ifort) with two different levels of optimization (O2 and O3) have been tested, but no significant differences between these compilers and options were found.
In addition, two different built-in integration modules of `qgs` have been considered: a non-parallel integrator located in the module `integrators.integrate` and a parallel one located in the module `integrators.integrator`.
The latter can integrate multiple trajectories simultaneously, but for the purpose of the benchmark, only one trajectory was computed with it, the other implementations being non-parallel.

The results of this benchmark are depicted on \autoref{fig:benchmark} and show that `qgs`, while not the fastest implementation of MAOOAM available, is a fair competitor. 
The time difference is in general not greater than a factor 5 and tends to be less for high-dimensional model configurations, with an integration time 
roughly the same as the Lua implementation. We note that there is also a significant difference between the parallel and non-parallel implementation of `qgs`, but this difference also seems to vanish for higher-resolution model configurations.
In any case, the parallel integrator of `qgs` can straightforwardly integrate multiple trajectories simultaneously and therefore has an advantage over the non-parallel one (provided that multiple CPU cores are available).
A final remark is that the initial Python version of MAOOAM [found in @MAOOAM] takes 283 minutes to integrate the low-resolution model configuration (not shown).

![Computational times in seconds of different MAOOAM implementations: (a) time to compute a 10$^7$ timeunits trajectory with a low-order model configuration (36 variables). (b) time to compute a 10$^6$ timeunits trajectory with a higher-order model configuration (228 variables). \label{fig:benchmark}](timing_results.pdf)
 
In conclusion, `qgs` is a sufficiently fast Python implementation as compared to the other implementations of the MAOOAM model. In addition, it has the benefit of being more flexible, extensible, and easier to use in the general Python scientific ecosystem.
